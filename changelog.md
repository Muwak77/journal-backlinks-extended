# Changelog

## Version 0.12.4

## Version 0.12.5


- When a journal page is linked, it now receives an anchor link in the journal entry's sidebar navigation. This link points directly to the "Backlinks" section of the page.

- An error-message in the console was suspended that appered, when journal categories war not installed
